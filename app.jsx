// Drives backfill, growth, promotions, M&A, and EC hiring in coupled fashion.
//
// Rules:
//   - Each year we lose attritionPct% of the active HC at year start (compounds).
//   - promoPctPerYear% of eligible HC (L1-L4 ICs ≈ 85% of org) is promoted up one level.
//     L2→L3 specifically converts EC into experienced (drains the EC pool).
//     Vacated slots (any level) become backfill demand on top of attrition.
//   - acquisitionsPerYear[i] = { count, ecPct } adds HC at year i without recruiting.
//     Counts toward growth target — recruiting only fills the gap.
//   - Net growth is split across 3 years by user-supplied weights (must sum to ~100).
//   - Gross hiring per year = attrition backfill + promotion backfill + (growth − acquired).
//   - EC% applies to gross hires per year:
//       * "hireMix" mode → EC = mixPct of every year's gross
//       * "orgMix" mode → solve so end-of-Y3 org EC% hits target, compensating for EC drain
//         from attrition + L2 promotions and EC lift from acquired EC.
//   - Backfills default to the same level as the vacated slot (attrition + promotion both).
